# The Tempo of Time: How Music Changes Throughout the Day
**How do people's listening habits change based on the time of day?**

This repository collects data from the Spotify API on playlists; it looks to playlists with names that reference a specific time of day (e.g. 'Morning Wakeup', 'Afternoon Vibes', 'Night Chill') and explores the audio features of their tracklists. The audio features emphasized are tempo (speed), valence (upbeat-ness), loudness, instrumentalness, energy, and danceability. These audio features are compared between the times of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night, as defined by [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/eb/qa/parts-of-the-day-early-morning-late-morning-etc)).
